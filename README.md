# Digital Logic Circuit (Reti Logiche) Project - 2022

Digital Logic Circuit (Reti Logiche) Project - Politecnico di Milano - Academic Year 2021/2022

## Overview

This project, completed as part of a course at POLIMI, focuses on the design and implementation of a hardware component described in VHDL. The component interfaces with a memory system and processes sequences using a convolutional code (Â½ rate), commonly used in telecommunications to ensure reliable data transmission. The design encodes input sequences into output sequences by applying a transformation that doubles the number of words. The project involves the creation of a state machine (FSM) to manage the encoding process and interaction with memory.

**Final grade**: 30/30
